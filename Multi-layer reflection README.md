# pythonprojects
A compilation of my first year python projects

My multi-layer reflection script is my most advanced script to date and I'm still continuing to improve.

The script takes in user inputs for the number of subsurface layers, their thicknesses and seismic velocities, and returns an offset vs traveltime pyplot
and outputs the offsets and traveltimes to .csv format in the project folder.

The script takes advantage of arrays and broadcasting to handle an "infinite" amount of cases specified by the user.
