# pythonprojects
A compilation of my first year python projects

My Gassman's fluid replacement script only considers the dry frame, water, and oil bulk moduli

The script reads in raw values from a .csv ("17_dry_samples.csv) to get started and is currently set up to handle a finite(17) number of cases.

However, this script could easily be adjusted to handle an "infinite" number of cases.
