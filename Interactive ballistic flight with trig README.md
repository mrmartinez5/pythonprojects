# pythonprojects
A compilation of my first year python projects

The interactive ballistic flight using trigonometry is my first ever python script.

First, the script asks for an initial angle and velocity from the user and validates that the inputs are legitimate.

Then, the script computes the maximum vertical height and horizontal distance traveled in an ideal condition.

This script ignores the shape and center of mass of the missile and ignores drag and other resistant forces.
